This folder contains several functions/script that are meant to be used with brainstorm
software http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction (Tadel et al., 2011)
for advanced scripting.

In the folder there are some functions I developed, that are to be used with brainstorm.
To avoid confusion with internal brainstorm functions, that sometimes are preceded by
"bst" (eg., "bst_get", "bst_set", ,etc.), 
I put "bst" at the end of my function names (e.g. "group_by_str_bst").

All functions ar provided without any warranty (as usual).
