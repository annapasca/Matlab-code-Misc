This folder contains several functions/script that are meant to be used with brainstorm
software http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction (Tadel et al., 2011)
for advanced scripting.

To avoid confusion with brainstorm functions, in which several functions are preceded by
"bst" (eg., "bst_get", "bst_set", ,etc.)
I put "bst" at the end of the function names

All functions ar provided without any warranty (as usual).
