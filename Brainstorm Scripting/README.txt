This folder contains several functions/script that are meant to be used with brainstorm
software http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction (Tadel et al., 2011)
for advanced scripting.

In the folder there are some functions I developed, that are to be used with brainstorm.
To avoid confusion with internal brainstorm functions, that sometimes are preceded by
"bst" (eg., "bst_get", "bst_set", ,etc.), 
I put "bst" at the end of my function names (e.g. "group_by_str_bst").

Most of the scripts are just general scripts I developed to tackle specific problems with brainstorm.
All scripts refers to a dummy dataset of mine. But the solution are general (for example how to extract scout time series for 
Time frequency data and analyze them)


All functions ar provided without any warranty.
